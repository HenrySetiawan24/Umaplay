# AMD GPU Support (ROCm) - Experimental

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental Support**
> This setup has been tested primarily on the **AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE**.
> Succes with other AMD cards is **not guaranteed** and may vary depending on your specific hardware and driver version.
> Use at your own risk.

This fork adds experimental support for AMD GPUs using **ROCm** on Windows. This allows the heaviest workload—**YOLO object detection**—to run on your GPU, significantly reducing CPU usage.

## Architecture

| Component | Runs On | libraries | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YOLO** (Detection) | 🎮 **GPU** | `ultralytics` + `torch` (ROCm) | **Massive Gain**: Offloads ~55% CPU load. 2-3x faster detection. |
| **OCR** (Text) | 🖥️ **CPU** | `paddlepaddle` + `paddleocr` | **Minor Trade-off**: Runs on CPU (standard Windows build). Disabling oneDNN (see below) costs ~10-20% speed but ensures stability. |

## Prerequisites

1.  **AMD GPU**: A modern AMD Radeon GPU (e.g., RX 6000/7000/9000 series).
    *   **Note for RX 7900 GRE Users**: While not explicitly listed in the ROCm 7.2 release notes, it is supported by ROCm 6.0+. If it doesn't work out-of-the-box, try setting the environment variable `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0` (matching the 7900 series architecture).
2.  **OS**: Windows 10/11.
3.  **Drivers**: **AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 26.1.1** (or newer).
    *   *Note*: This specific driver is required for ROCm 7.2 support on Windows.
4.  **Python**: **Python 3.12** is strictly required. The ROCm 7.2 wheels provided by AMD are built for this specific version.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Set Up Python Environment

Create a clean environment specifically for AMD ROCm (Python 3.12).

```bash
conda create -n env_uma python=3.12
conda activate env_uma
```

### 2. Install ROCm 7.2 SDK

Install the core ROCm SDK components required for PyTorch to interface with your AMD GPU.

```cmd
pip install --no-cache-dir --pre ^
    https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/rocm_sdk_core-7.2.0.dev0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl ^
    https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/rocm_sdk_devel-7.2.0.dev0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl ^
    https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/rocm_sdk_libraries_custom-7.2.0.dev0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl ^
    https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/rocm-7.2.0.dev0.tar.gz
```
*(If using PowerShell, replace `^` with `` ` ``)*

### 3. Install PyTorch with ROCm 7.2 Support

Install the PyTorch wheels built for ROCm.

```cmd
pip install --no-cache-dir --pre ^
  https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/torch-2.9.1%2Brocmsdk20260116-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl ^
  https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/torchaudio-2.9.1%2Brocmsdk20260116-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl ^
  https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/windows/rocm-rel-7.2/torchvision-0.24.1%2Brocmsdk20260116-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
```
*(If using PowerShell, replace `^` with `` ` ``)*

### 4. Install Remaining Dependencies

Install the rest of the bot's requirements (like PaddleOCR for CPU) using the AMD-specific requirements file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-amd.txt
```

---

### Alternative Installation (Older ROCm 6.2 / Python 3.10)

If you are unable to use the ROCm 7.2 / Python 3.12 setup above, an older approach using ROCm 6.2 and Python 3.10 is also available:

```bash
conda create -n uma_amd python=3.10 -y
conda activate uma_amd
```

Install PyTorch from the nightly ROCm 6.2 index:

```bash
pip install --pre torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.2
```

For PaddlePaddle (OCR), install the standard CPU version — YOLO (the heavy workload) will still run on your AMD GPU:

```bash
pip install paddlepaddle paddleocr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: The alternative route uses an older Python (3.10) and an older ROCm version (6.2). You may miss some fixes and optimizations from the 7.2 setup. The newer ROCm 7.2 guide above is the recommended path.

---

## Verification

To verify that your environment is correctly set up, run the included test script:

```bash
python tests/test_amd.py
```

**What this script checks:**
1.  **PyTorch ROCm**: Use `torch.cuda.is_available()` to verify the GPU is visible. It should print your AMD GPU name and the ROCm version.
2.  **PaddlePaddle**: Checks compilation status.
3.  **HIP SDK**: Checks if `hipconfig` is available.

## Troubleshooting & Technical Details

### PaddleOCR Crashes & Environment Variables
If you inspect `core/perception/ocr/ocr_local.py`, you'll see logic that automatically sets:

```python
if is_rocm:
    os.environ["FLAGS_use_mkldnn"] = "0"
    os.environ["FLAGS_enable_pir_api"] = "0"
```

**What this does:**
*   It detects if you are running on an AMD ROCm system (by checking `torch.version.hip`).
*   If yes, it disables **oneDNN** (Intel MKLDNN) and the new **PIR API**.
*   **Reason**: PaddlePaddle 3.x often crashes on Windows/ROCm systems with `ConvertPirAttribute2RuntimeAttribute` errors due to conflicts with oneDNN. Disabling it is the only stable fix, even though it might slightly reduce CPU OCR speed.
*   **Note**: This is applied *automatically* only for AMD users. NVIDIA/Intel users retain full CPU optimization.

### "hipconfig" not found
If `tests/test_amd.py` says `hipconfig` is missing, ensure you have installed the HIP SDK if you plan to do any development.

### VS C++ Redistributable
If you get "DLL load failed" errors when importing torch, ensure you have the latest **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** installed.
